# Converting Static Website to Astro Framework: Documentation

This project aims to convert a static website into the Astro framework, leveraging Astro's modern static site generation capabilities for improved performance, maintainability, and responsiveness.

## Introduction

The provided static website has been converted into the Astro framework, utilizing HTML, CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind), and Vanilla JavaScript. The conversion process involved refactoring the codebase into reusable Astro components, implementing responsive design principles, and optimizing performance using Astro's features.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

  - **Partner**: Located in `src/content/homepage/partner`.
    - Add new partners using Markdown files with `Number` and `description`.
      -Remember that position is an `array` as the person can have multiple positions in the company, so you have to enclose the whole position content in square brackets `[]`, text in double quotes `""`, and separate each text with a comma `,`.
  - **Purpose**: Located in `src/content/homepage/purpose`.
    - Add new purposes using Markdown files with `Number` and `description`.
  - **Significance**: Located in `src/content/homepage/significance`.
    - Add new significance content using Markdown files with `Number`, `intro`, `point` (array), and `end`.
    - Remember that point is an `array` so you have to enclose the whole point content in square brackets `[]`, text in double quotes `""`, and separate each text with a comma `,`.

- **Navbar Routes**: Located in `src/content/navbarRoutes`.

  - Add new routes using Markdown files with `Number`, `path`, and `name`.
  - For same page links, use `#` followed by the section id and for external links, use the full URL.

- **Partners Carousel Logos**: Located in `src/content/partnersCarouselLogos`.

  - Add new partner logos to the carousel using Markdown files with `Number`, `img`, `alt`, and `link`.
  - link is optional, keep it blank `""` if not available.
  - The carousel is designed to show 4 logos at a time, if you want to change it, you can change the corresponding grid layout and chunk.ts file.

- **Resources Page**: Located in `src/content/resourcesPage`.

  - Add new resources using Markdown files with `Number`, `heading`, and `points` (list).
  - Add hyphen and for `text` and `link`, keep the `title` encloded in square brackets `[]` and then the `link` in round brackets `()`.

## Challenges Faced

Adapting the navbar, accordion, and carousel components for mobile responsiveness proved challenging, as reliance on pre-made templates from Bootstrap and Tailwind was not viable within the Astro framework. Designing these components from scratch required extensive time and effort, especially as I lacked prior experience in creating responsive designs independently.
